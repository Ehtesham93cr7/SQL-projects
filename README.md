# Real-Time SQL Project: Comprehensive Analysis of the 2024 India General Elections Results

In this advanced SQL project, I conducted a detailed analysis of the 2024 India General Elections results using a MySQL database. This hands-on project involved working with five CSV files, providing a real-world scenario that allowed me to develop invaluable skills in data analysis and SQL.

Key Highlights of the Project:
1. Advanced Join Operations:
Successfully executed complex join operations across multiple tables to extract meaningful insights from interconnected datasets.

2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes:
Applied robust ETL techniques to clean, transform, and load real-world data into the database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

3. Schema Design and ERD Implementation:
Designed and implemented database schemas and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to establish clear relationships between the data entities.

4. Utilization of Advanced SQL Functions:
Used advanced SQL functions and techniques for complex data manipulations, such as ranking, window functions, and aggregations.
